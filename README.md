# Tiger-Axolotl

## Game Structure

Roguelite open-world, wuxia-inspired RPG.

Inspired by:
- *Soul Knight* style moment-to-moment gameplay
- *Slay the Spire* style progression mechanics
- *Fallout 4* style skill tree design

## Art Direction

- Final character sprites: hand-drawn on paper
- Prototype character visuals: mostly circles

## Character and Progression

- Start with one default character
- Character stats vary based on selected class/background
- Character creation menu aims for a *Fallout/Skyrim*-style feel

### Leveling System

- Two primary skill trees:
  - Sword
  - Magic
- Current direction is to keep both trees available rather than locking by class

## World Design

Large fantasy world themed around ancient China.

- North and west: hyper-hostile regions
- East: coastal and commerce-focused
- South: jungle region focused on plants/farming
- Center: starter village (player spawn area)

### Camera Behavior

- Zoomed out during exploration
- Zoomed in during encounters

## Roguelite Loop

After completing a run, the player can start a **school**.

On new runs, the next character can become that school's disciple to gain benefits. School quality and traits can be influenced by actions from previous runs.

Potential meta-progression additions:
- Achievements -> points -> passive/active skills/items

## Dynamic World Features

- Persistent, evolving world state
- Possible Nemesis-style enemy NPC system (may be too ambitious for prototype scope)

## Possible Enemies

- Bilwis and Druden
- Leshiye
- Will-o'-the-wisps
- Nokken
- Alp-luachras
- Changelings and doppelgangers
- Stryzygas
- Automatons
- Dragonkin
- Carbuncles
- Spirits / elemental entities (nature aspects)
- Ghosts, bone knights (skeletons), and liches
- Possessed weapons (flying)
